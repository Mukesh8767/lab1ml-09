Linear Regression Basics Lab
This repository contains code and examples for a basic linear regression implementation. The Jupyter Notebook (LAB1_Basics.ipynb) demonstrates how to perform linear regression, calculate the cost function, and use gradient descent to optimize the model parameters.

Linear Regression Overview
The notebook covers:

Data Loading: Loading the dataset and visualizing it.
Hypothesis Function: Defining the linear regression hypothesis.
Cost Function: Calculating the cost of the linear regression model.
Gradient Descent: Using gradient descent to optimize the parameters.
Model Evaluation: Evaluating the model with the final parameters.
Example Output
The final output after running the notebook shows the optimized parameters (Theta) and the final cost value.
